The `frontend-nginx`, `sql`, `backend-sql` folders are docker-compose configurations for each component. The purpose of these folders is to help test docker in parts before combining them into an official docker compose file. The `production` folder includes the official docker compose file and nginx configuration file to upload to the server.
